The goal of this program is to fulfill a personal project of checking stock of physical stores. This is mostly for pokemon cards, but it can be used for anything if you have the TCIN (product number)
This is done differently for each store as they each have their own challenges

Goals:
Create stock checker for walmart
Create stock checker for bestbuy
Create stock checker for fredmeyers?

Finished:
Stock checker for Target

Features:
Target:
  * Searches for closest n amount of stores (customizable)
  * Searches for the top 10 best selling pokemon cards and newest 10 products
  * Uses those 20 tcins as well as a manual list (for any tcins people put in custom folder) and searches all closest n stores
  * reports back all availability, last seen, price, tcin and inserts them all to SQLite
